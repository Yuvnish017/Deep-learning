# Deep-learning

Hey Folks,
I am currently going through an online course on Coursera on Neural Network and Deep Learning. It's the first part of specialization on Deep Learning.
It is really an amazing course. 
In the 2nd week of this course I was given a programming assignment on Logistic Regression which I successfully completed.
In this assignment I had to write the code according to instructions to recognize whether an image passed to the code is an image of a cat or not.
"cat recognition.py" is the main code where we first train our model on training set in dataset folder and then test the code on an image.
man.jpg, cat.jpg, cat1.jpg are the images I used to test apart from test dataset in dataset folder.
